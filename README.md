# Hello World v2

This is my website â€” there are many like it, but this is mine.

After using the GTN (Gatsby, ThemeUI, Netlify) stack for about 5 years, I've decided (been forced to) consider alternatives. Some lessons I've learned in the past month of reading:

### Things I'm going to keep doing

- **Portability** - make it easy to move stuff
- **Simplicity** - keep things reasonable
- **Theming** - ideas that I had ~3 years ago have become reality

### Things I'm going to change
- **Indepedence** - don't overly commit to a given piece of tech
- **Composability** - add/remove things easily based on requirements
- **Sharpen the saw** - this is my first major update in ~2 years, and I'm very.rusty.co

## Neue Stack

- **Remix** - framework
- **Vite** - plugins
- **Fly** - hosting
- **Radix** - UI
- **Tailwind** - styling
- **MDX** - content
