# <figure className='m-0'>When guys share referral links, you have to understand it's a sign of great respect in their culture. <figcaption> Paul Hanaoka</figcaption></figure>

What is it about human nature that makes people want to share things? 

One reason could be because we're social creatures. We want to connect with others and share our experiences. We want to feel like we're part of something bigger than ourselves. We want to know, and be known. 

Philosophical reasons aside &mdash; I'm collecting and sharing these links here because I have loose plans to create guides (like [Brian did for staying safe on the internet](https://brianlovin.com/security?referer=https://paul.hanaoka.co)) and starting collections of things is my first step to that.

_*I am including referral links in some of these recommendations &mdash; obviously you are free to use them (or not!) &mdash; the real reward is just someone else agreeing with my choice on a thing._
