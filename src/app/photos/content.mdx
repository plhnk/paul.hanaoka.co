One of my earliest hobbies, photography continues to be a source of great joy.

I used to share my photos pretty regularly on Unsplash but the spirit of giving back to a community of creatives died in me when they were acquired by Getty Images.

I've debated taking my photos down, but currently settled for not uploading any new ones.

_Since they're still there, here's some of my favorites._
