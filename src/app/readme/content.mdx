# Working with me <span className="text-text/50">last updated: June 23, 2024</span>

_Inspired by [Julie Zhuo’s post](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-a-user-guide-to) and [Malte Ubl](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/malte-handbook/) and [Hardik Pandya's](https://hvpandya.com/working-with-me/) sites I’ve begun a handbook/user guide of my own that I’m calling my `readme`._

{/* ## I’d enjoy working with you if… */}

## How I like to work

- I’m a note-taker, it helps me process information during meetings and ensuring there’s clear outcomes and actions from a meeting is my love language.
- In a similar vein, I make lots of lists &mdash; TODOs are how I stay sane and get things done.
- I’m a believer in small improvements, compounding over time.

{/* ## How I view success */}

## How I communicate

- I tend to ramble when speaking, so I prefer to write, edit, and rewrite in order to communicate more clearly and concisely.
- Through many cases of foot-in-mouth-itis, I’ve learned that it’s better for me to think more before I speak — as a result I’m not as direct as I’d like to be. This is something I’m working on, especially when giving feedback. I work very hard to build trust in relationships so that my feedback can be received more positively. 

## Things I do that may annoy you

- My default is to expect better &mdash; it’s in my nature to see what can be improved, but I’m working hard to acknowledge good work and effort first before suggesting ways to improve. If I immediately start off by sharing ideas or improvements, know that it’s not that I don’t appreciate what’s there, it’s that I love it so much and want to see what’s next.
- I have very strong opinions about most things &mdash; however I also work very hard to maintain an open mind and am quick to change when presented with a compelling, logical argument, and/or scientific data.

{/* ## What gains and loses my trust */}

## What I do well

- Executing and doing
- Scaling and making processes more efficient
- Seeing the big picture and connecting the dots between what the goal is and what we need to do to get there

## What I’m working on

- Selling and promoting work
- Being tactical and strategic about scaling the right thing at the right time
- Taking time to learn more before optimizing

## Don’t just take my word for it...

As they say, you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with &mdash; at various points throughout my career I’ve had the privilege of working with and learning from many excellent people, a few were kind of enough to share some kind words:
