# Working with me <span className="text-text/50">last updated: June 19, 2024</span>

Inspired by [Julie Zhuo’s post](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-a-user-guide-to), [Malte Ubl](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/malte-handbook/), and [Hardik Pandya](https://hvpandya.com/working-with-me/) I’ve begun a handbook/user guide of my own that I’m calling my `readme`.

{/* ## Background / Context */}

{/* ## Values / Principles / Beliefs */}

{/* ## Engineering / Product / Design Style */}

{/* ## Professional Style \ */}

{/* ## I’d enjoy working with you if… */}

## Here’s how I work

- I take notes
- I love lists
- I like to

{/* ## How I view success */}

## How I communicate

## Things I do that may annoy you

## What gains and loses my trust

## What I do well

## What I’m working on

{/* ## What I expect from people I manage */}

{/* ## How I give and receive feedback */}

{/* ## Stuff I do */}

## Personal

- Married for {yearsSince(2010)} years
- 4 kids ({yearsSince(2023)}, {yearsSince(2021)}, {yearsSince(2019)}, &amp; {yearsSince(2017)})

## Don’t just take my word for it...

As they say, you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with &mdash; at various points throughout my career I’ve had the privilege of spending time with and learning from these people.
