# Working with me <span className="text-text/50">last updated: June 19, 2024</span>

Inspired by [Julie Zhuo’s post](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-a-user-guide-to), [Malte Ubl](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/malte-handbook/), and [Hardik Pandya](https://hvpandya.com/working-with-me/) I’ve begun a handbook/user guide of my own that I’m calling my `readme`.

{/* ## Background / Context */}

{/* ## Values / Principles / Beliefs */}

{/* ## Engineering / Product / Design Style */}

{/* ## Professional Style \ */}

{/* ## I’d enjoy working with you if… */}

## How I like to work

- I take notes
- I love lists
- I live for small improvements, compounding over time

{/* ## How I view success */}

## How I communicate

- I’m better at writing than speaking — I can tend to ramble, which is one of the reasons I prefer to not say much. When writing, I have the chance to edit and rewrite in order to communicate more clearly and concisely.

## Things I do that may annoy you

- My default is to expect better &mdash; it’s in my nature to see what can be improved, but I’m working hard to acknowledge good work and effort first before suggesting ways to improve.

{/* ## What gains and loses my trust */}

## What I do well

- Executing
- Scaling

## What I’m working on

- Selling
- Living out the truth that not everything needs to be scaled or optimized right away

{/* ## What I expect from people I manage */}

{/* ## How I give and receive feedback */}  

{/* ## Stuff I do */}

## Personal

- Married for {yearsSince(2010)} years
- 4 kids ({yearsSince(2023)}, {yearsSince(2021)}, {yearsSince(2019)}, &amp; {yearsSince(2017)})
- Woodworking
- [Smoked 550lbs of meat in 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lrz8Dqgx_e63juiD8JIdQTxVg_8j9NFvdX6dvNyPA-Q/edit?usp=sharing)

## Don’t just take my word for it...

As they say, you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with &mdash; at various points throughout my career I’ve had the privilege of spending time with and learning from these people.
