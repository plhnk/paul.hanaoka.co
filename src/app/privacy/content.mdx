I value your privacy and do my best to not collect any personal information. I do intend to or knowingly collect any information from you unless explicitly stated. I will not share any information with any third party unless you have given me permission to do so.

When you click the 'Locate Me' button on the Weather widget, the browser uses the geolocation API to determine your location. I do not store this information. If you do not wish to share your location, that is fine. I would suggest disabling this at the browser level.
