  <div className="col-start-2 mb-16 col-span-6">
    Through a design sprint, I helped the team ideate to a largely non-interface solution would provide the most value to our customers.

    This was achieved in three ways:
    1. Adding more granular permissions and dedicated roles for translators
    1. Adding `.xlf` import/export features to the existing content editing interface
    1. Exposing an API and providing endpoints for integration with translation services

  <h3 className="small-caps max-md:col-span-5 lg:col-start-2 mt-6">Process</h3>
  <div className="col-start-2 col-span-6">
    To translate content, users chose a language at the page level, which meant 1 page at a time:

    className="-ml-4 !col-span-9" 
  />
</div>

<div className="!col-start-2 my-16 col-span-6">
 To better understand how people used the existing features, I conducted interviews with three user groups:

    1. End-users: Direct feedback from customers and internal teams focused on goals, processes, and pain points.
    1. Customer Support: Gathered indirect user feedback and learned about the most common issues reported by customers.
    1. Consulting Services: Customer requirements from common customizations made to the product.

Two of the most important insights from these interviews helped shape the solution.

      <User />
      Larger customers often added vendors as users to their instance to
      translate content for them &mdash; this would often result in errors and
      was also cost-prohibitive.

      height={800}
    />
    <div className="ml-4">
      By defining specific roles for translators this helped reduce the ability
      of vendors to inadvertently access, modify, or delete content &mdash; thus
      reducing costs and errors.

        Spreadsheets were the artifact that customers used to connect Liferay and the goal they were trying to achieve (translated content).

      Adding the ability to export and import content as .xlf files eliminated the need for customers to use a spreadsheet to manage translations.

  <div className="col-start-2 col-span-5">
      While not exactly the sexiest case study in the world, working on this problem
  was rewarding because of the customer outcomes we were able to achieve. 
  
  By focusing on their problems we created a huge amount of value, eliminated thousands of hours
  of busywork, enabling our customers and their customers to spend time doing more meaningful work.
