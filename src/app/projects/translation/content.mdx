To better understand pain points and clarify requirements, we conducted interviews with three key groups:

1. Customer Support: Gathered indirect user feedback and learned about the most common issues reported by customers.
1. Consulting Services: Customer requirements from common customizations made to the product.
1. End-users: Direct feedback from customers and internal teams focused on goals, processes, and pain points.

After synthesizing findings, we aligned on this problem statement:

<div className="w-full h-32" />

> Our global customers struggle to translate content efficiently. The current translation process uses the same interface designed for creating content, not translation workflows. This outdated approach wastes time, causes errors, and delays getting localized content to international audiences.

### Dedicated Translation Interface

While exploring the export/import experience, we realized that the existing content editing interface was not optimized for translation tasks. Translators often work with specific requirements, such as character limits, formatting constraints, and the need to provide context for ambiguous terms.

We designed a dedicated translation interface that addressed these needs, featuring:

- Side-by-side view of source and target languages
- In-context previews and WYSIWYG editing
- Terminology management and glossary integration
- Translation memory and machine translation suggestions
- Workflow and collaboration tools (e.g., comments, task assignments)
- Translator-specific roles and permissions

### Automatic Translation Integration

During our research, we discovered that some customers were interested in using automatic translation as a starting point, either to test content in new markets or to reduce translation costs by leveraging post-editing workflows.

We explored integrating with various translation APIs and services, allowing customers to automatically translate content within our platform. This feature included:

- Configurable translation settings (e.g., language pairs, translation quality)
- Bulk translation of multiple pages or content types
- Post-editing tools for refining machine-translated content
- Cost estimation and billing integration for translation services

While these enhancements addressed many of the core pain points, we identified several areas for future exploration and improvement:

- **Localization Analytics**: Provide insights and reporting on translation progress, costs, and performance to help customers optimize their localization efforts.
- **Adaptive Translation Workflows**: Dynamically adjust translation workflows based on content type, target audience, and other contextual factors.
- **Multilingual Content Creation**: Explore features that enable content creators to author and manage multilingual content natively within our platform, reducing the need for separate translation workflows.
- **Personalization and Transcreation**: Enhance support for culturally-adapted content beyond direct translations, such as transcreation (recreating content for a specific culture) and personalization based on user preferences or location.
