    Creating a home on the web for our burgeoning design team was one way to compete with cool startups who were able to lure top talent.
    
    On one hand, yes — this was just a few websites — but it was also so much more. It became a vehicle for us to learn and grow together.
    
    Along the way, I learned a ton about management, engineering, marketing, and how hard it is to design for designers.

    Was this a good idea?

    Absolutely yes. The team loved being able to have one place to go and find almost anything they needed.

    Would I do it again?

    "It depends."

    There are so many factors to consider, at the time I started it, I didn’t realize how much time and effort I and others would pour into it. While it was a great way to learn a lot, and especially helped me level-up as a react developer, I would really need to consider the goals and long-term impacts before I would undertake something like this again.
