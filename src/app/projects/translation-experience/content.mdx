    Through a design sprint, I helped the team ideate to a largely non-interface solution would provide the most value to our customers.

    This was achieved in three ways:
    1. Adding more granular permissions and dedicated roles for translators
    1. Adding `.xlf` import/export features to the existing content editing interface
    1. Exposing an API and providing endpoints for integration with translation services

  <h3 className="small-caps max-md:col-span-3 mt-1">Process</h3>
  <div className="md:max-lg:col-start-2 col-span-6">
    I conducted interviews with three user groups to better understand how people used the existing features:

    1. End-users: Direct feedback from customers and internal teams focused on goals, processes, and pain points.
    1. Customer Support: Gathered indirect user feedback and learned about the most common issues reported by customers.
    1. Consulting Services: Customer requirements from common customizations made to the product.

Two important insights from these interviews helped shape the solution:

        Larger customers often added vendors as users to their instance to translate
        content for them &mdash; this would often result in errors and was also cost-prohibitive.

    While this wasn't an entirely UI-less solution, interactions followed conventional patterns.

    I added value by understanding and explaining user pain, helping the team to ideate and prioritize effort through business outcomes. We were able to expend the same (or less) effort on implementing the right solution quickly.

    By focusing on user problems we created a huge amount of value, eliminated thousands of hoursof busywork, enabling our customers and their customers to spend their time doing more meaningful work.
