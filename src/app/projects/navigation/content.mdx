    Improving our understanding of the user was a critical first step. 
    
    I interviewed a variety of users, summarized the qualitative data, and facilitated ideation sessions.

    One outcome was an updated map of where the different user groups did most of their work.

    When working with a high degree of ambiguity, it’s often useful to diverge and pursue a wide range of ideas and threads to uncover things that work.

      Shipping a feature of this magnitude at enterprise scale gave me a new appreciation for the value of effective change management.
      
      One difficult tradeoff in the moment was cutting a custom menu builder and instead implementing a way for site admins to enable the new nav at the pace of their organization.
