    Improving our understanding of the user was a critical first step. 
    
    I interviewed a variety of users, summarized the qualitative data, and facilitated ideation sessions.

    One outcome was an updated map of where the different user groups did most of their work.

    Because this impacted so many teams, I wanted to ensure as many , I found it useful to pursue a wide range of ideas to uncover things that could work, test them and iterate.

      Shipping a feature of this magnitude at enterprise scale gave me a new appreciation for the value of effective change management.
      
      One difficult tradeoff in the moment was cutting a custom menu builder and instead implementing a way for site admins to enable the new nav at the pace of their organization.
