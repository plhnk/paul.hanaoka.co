<Summary
  problem={
    'Adoption for two major feature updates was low, revenue had lagged for consecutive quarters, and new customer targets were below goal projections. \n A steady uptick in UX bugs had been reported since the last major release — previous to this, there was not a single team responsible for the platform-wide experience, so our working hypothesis was we could make outsized (yet cost-effective) improvements by doing it at the platform level with a single, small team.'
  }
  role={
    'As Product Design lead, I collaborated with the Technical lead and PM to develop a strategy, ideating in tight feedback loops through execution. \n I consulted with Product Designers while building requirements and coached them through applying improvements in specific platform areas.'

    Setting a clear vision is the first step to any successful project — together with a PM, we drafted a pitch deck to the rest of the platform teams as a way to inspire them to contribute to the larger goal of improving UX at the platform level. 
    
    After hosting an initial async brainstorm with designers to capture the problem screens in their areas, I then categorized and documented the issues at the component level.
    
    As a cross-functional leadership team we met to review the components and run an evaluation matrix exercise to focus our efforts.

        By all accounts the project was a great success — in addition to
        increased usability scores (an important component of the perceived
        value) revenue and new business goals were exceeded in the quarters
        following this release. A major reason for the success was the team’s
        ability to focus and prioritize. Because we had a clear goal and clear
        budget constraints we could quickly determine what was feasible and
        viable, maximizing value produced.
