I grew up in North County, San Diego and spent 15 years living in LA before moving to Bellingham, WA &mdash; the city of subdued excitement.

Like many teenagers, I had very little idea what I wanted to do with my life. I've loved building and designing from a young age, and I spent my high school summers working in construction. 

I started a pre-architecture degree in college, but that was short-lived due to the combination of basically flunking Calc II and discovering that graphic design was a thing. Thankfully, I had the self-awareness _[my parents telling me]_ that my skills as a designer would likely not provide a living wage, I also studied business &mdash; which I thoroughly enjoyed. 

While I was still in college, I learned to develop rudimentary websites and grew from there. While a few of the engineers I’ve worked with may disagree, I’ve grown to be a capable front-end developer, contributing bits of code to sites, products, and systems.

I’ve spent the better part of the last decade at an enterprise software company, where I started as the first web designer, moved into UX and product design and gradually (together with other many talented designers, led by [Juan Hidalgo](https://hidalgo.design)) built a [multi-disciplinary design org](https://liferay.design).
