This site 
- built using NextJS
    - 5 years ago I built a site using GatsbyJS, and I wanted to try something new — NextJS has become an industry leader in the React space, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about
- hosted on Vercel
    - seemed to make sense using the same company that built the framework
- using components from Radix UI and Shadcn
    - coming from ThemeUI, Radix and Shadcn both seemed like good options
- styled using TailwindCSS
    - I've been wanting to use Tailwind for awhile, this seemed like a great opportunity
- themed using TailwindCSS and Shadcn
    - I started using Radix Themes but it wasn't as immediately obvious to me how to go beyond Dark/Light themes – and Shadcn documentation had Tailwind specs that made sense to me
