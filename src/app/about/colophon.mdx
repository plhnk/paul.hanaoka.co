## Typography

- [Butterick's Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) is a book I've read over and over and continue to reference.

## [Fira Sans](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/)

- Open source typeface designed by one of my favorite typographers ([Erik Spiekermann](https://spiekermann.com/en/)).
- Stop Stealing Sheep & Find Out How Type Works by Spiekermann was one of (if not the first) book I read on typography.

## Charter

## Thanks

So many people have influenced the design and development of this site &mdash; most of them don't even know it, for which I'm grateful.
