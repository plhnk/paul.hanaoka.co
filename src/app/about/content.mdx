# Passionate about building, scaling, and helping people.

I grew up in SoCal, living in the South Bay of LA for 15 years before moving to the city of subdued excitement (Bellingham, WA). 

Like many teenagers, I had very little idea what I wanted to do with my life. I've loved building and designing from a young age, and I spent my high school summers working in construction, so when I begin college I started in pre-architecture, but that was short-lived after the combination of almost flunking Calculus and discovering that graphic design was a thing. Thankfully, I had the self-awareness to know that my skills as a designer alone would likely not provide anything close to resembling a living wage I also studied business.

In my early post-grad years I began teaching myself to code. While most of the engineers I work with would probably disagree, I’ve grown to be a capable front-end developer, contributing production-ready code to sites, products, and systems.

I’ve spent the better part of the last decade at an enterprise software company, where I started as the first web designer and gradually (together with other many talented designers, under the leadership of Juan Hidalgo) built a multi-disciplinary design org.

At the beginning of 2024, after getting pretty burned out, I left my role as Head of Design to spend time with my family after the birth of our daughter.
