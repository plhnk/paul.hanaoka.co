# Thank you for visiting my small corner of the world wide web!

_Fun fact: "world wide web" has less syllables than "www"._ 

My name is Paul and I‘m a designer with a passion for building.

This is my digital workshop, garden, gallery, and notebook &mdash; it’s primary purpose is for me to learn, but I do hope it might help (or at least inform/mildly amuse) others, such as yourself.

If you have any feedback, ideas, or general questions, please don't hesitate to [shoot me an email](mailto:paul@hanaoka.co) _(hit `M` on your keyboard)_ or [book time on my calendar](https://cal.com/plhnk) _(hit `C` on your keyboard)_. I’ve benefitted greatly from people taking random meetings with me, and I hope to pay it forward.

{/* How much do you want to know? */}
{/* TODO make a component like Matt Smith's for this */}
