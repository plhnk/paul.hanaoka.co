# Thank you for visiting my small corner of the world wide web!

_Do you ever think about the fact that "world wide web" has less syllables than "www"?_

My name is Paul and I‘m a designer with a passion for building.

This is my digital workshop, garden, gallery, and notebook &mdash; it’s primary purpose is for me to learn, but I do hope it might help (or at least inform/mildly amuse) someone such as yourself.

If you have any feedback, ideas, or general questions, please don't hesitate to [shoot me an email](mailto:paul@hanaoka.co) _(hit `M` on your keyboard)_ or [book time on my calendar](https://cal.com/plhnk) _(hit `C` on your keyboard)_.

{/* TODO make a component like Matt Smith's for this */}

## Bio

I grew up in North County San Diego, but spent the 15 years living in LA before moving to the city of subdued excitement (Bellingham, WA).

Like many teenagers, I had very little idea what I wanted to do with my life. I've loved building and designing from a young age, and I spent my high school summers working in construction. I started a pre-architecture in college, but that was short-lived after the combination of basically flunking Calc II and discovering that graphic design was a thing. Thankfully, I had the self-awareness to know that my skills as a designer alone would likely not provide anything close to resembling a living wage I also studied business.

In my early post-grad years I began teaching myself to code. While most of the engineers I work with would probably disagree, I’ve grown to be a capable front-end developer, contributing production-ready code to sites, products, and systems.

I’ve spent the better part of the last decade at an enterprise software company, where I started as the first web designer and gradually (together with other many talented designers, under the leadership of [Juan Hidalgo](https://hidalgo.design)) built a [multi-disciplinary design org](https://liferay.design).

At the beginning of 2024, working through burnout, I left my role as Head of Design to spend time with my family after the birth of our daughter.
