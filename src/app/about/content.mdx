# Passionate about building, scaling, and helping people.

I grew up in SoCal, living in the South Bay of LA for 15 years before moving to the city of subdued excitement (Bellingham, WA). 

Being fully remote for the better part of 4 years has made me a more effective communicator and empathetic teammate.

Like most young people, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Because STEM came naturally to me, I began the path to architecture when I discovered graphic design in university. Having the self-awareness that my skills as a designer alone would likely not provide anything close to resembling a living wage I also studied business.

In my early post-grad years I began teaching myself to code. While most of the engineers I work with would probably disagree, I’ve grown to be a capable front-end developer, contributing production-ready code to sites, products, and systems.

I’ve spent the better part of the last decade building a multi-disciplinary design org at an enterprise software company.

At the beginning of 2024, I left my role to spend time with my family after the birth of our daughter.
