Passionate about building creative infrastructure, scaling brand and product, and helping people realize their potential.

Born in the PNW, I spent most of my life in SoCal, living in the South Bay of LA for 15 years before moving to Bellingham. Being fully remote for the better part of 4 years has made me a more effective communicator and empathetic teammate.

Like most young people, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Because STEM came naturally to me, I began the path to architecture when I discovered graphic design in university. Having the self-awareness that my skills as a designer alone would likely not provide anything close to resembling a living wage I also studied business.

In my early post-grad years I began teaching myself to code. I’ve since grown to be a capable front-end developer, contributing production-ready code to sites, products, and systems.

I’ve spent the better part of the last decade building a multi-disciplinary enterprise design organization. Our team designs a platform for emotion, loved by thousands of customers, and experienced by millions of people every day.

I used to have hobbies — now I have four small children, who I wouldn’t trade for all the single origin coffee, LEGO, books, or tools in the world.
