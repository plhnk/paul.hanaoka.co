# Hello World v2

_This is my website â€” there are many like it, but this is mine._

_if you're into old stuff, check out the previous version._

After using the GTN (Gatsby, ThemeUI, Netlify) stack for about 5 years, I've decided (been forced to) consider alternatives. Some lessons I've learned in the past month of reading:

### Things I'm going to keep doing

- Portability - make it easy to move stuff
- Simplicity - keep things reasonable
- Theming - ideas that I had ~3 years ago have become reality

### Things I'm going to change

- Indepedence - don't overly commit to a given piece of tech
- Composability - add/remove things easily based on requirements
- Sharpen the saw - this is my first major update in ~2 years, and I'm very.rusty.co

### Neue Stack

- NextJS
- MDX
- Radix?
- Tailwind?

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
