# Hello World v2

_This is my website â€” there are many like it, but this is mine._

Check it out at paul.hanaoka.co.

_if you're into old stuff, check out the previous version._

After using the GTN (Gatsby, ThemeUI, Netlify) stack for about 5 years, I've decided (been forced to) consider alternatives. Some lessons I've learned in the past month of reading:

### Things I'm going to keep doing

- Portability - make it easy to move stuff
- Simplicity - keep things reasonable
- Theming - ideas that I had ~3 years ago have become reality

### Things I'm going to change

- Indepedence - don't overly commit to a given piece of tech
- Composability - add/remove things easily based on requirements
- Sharpen the saw - this is my first major update in ~2 years, and I'm very.rusty.co

### Neue Stack

- NextJS
- MDX
- Radix?
- Tailwind?
